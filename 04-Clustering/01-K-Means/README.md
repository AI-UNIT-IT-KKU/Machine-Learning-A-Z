K-Means Clustering (Mall Customers Dataset)
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised learning algorithm used to group similar data points into clusters.

The dataset (Mall_Customers.csv) contains customer details, including:

Annual Income

Spending Score

Using K-Means, customers are segmented into groups to better understand their behaviors and spending patterns.

🚀 Why It’s Important

Customer segmentation → Helps businesses group customers (e.g., high spenders, budget buyers).

Unsupervised learning → Finds patterns without labeled data.

Data insights → Useful for marketing strategies, targeted advertising, and product recommendations.

Scalability → Works well with large datasets and is computationally efficient.

⚙️ What the Code Does

Import libraries → numpy, pandas, matplotlib.

Load the dataset (Mall_Customers.csv) → Extract relevant features (Annual Income and Spending Score).

Apply the Elbow Method → Determine the optimal number of clusters.

Train the K-Means model → Using the chosen number of clusters.

Predict cluster assignments → Assign each customer to a cluster.

Visualize customer groups → Plot clusters and their centroids for easy interpretation.
