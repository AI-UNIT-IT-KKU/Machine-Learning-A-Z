Random Forest Regression Example
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Random Forest Regression to predict salaries based on job position levels.

Unlike Linear Regression or a single Decision Tree, Random Forest combines multiple decision trees and averages their predictions. This makes it more powerful for modeling complex non-linear relationships.

🚀 Why It’s Important

Decision Trees can capture non-linear patterns but may easily overfit.

Random Forest Regression reduces this problem by averaging predictions from many trees, leading to:

Higher accuracy

Better generalization

Reduced sensitivity to noise

Commonly applied in finance, science, business analytics, and AI systems where prediction reliability matters.

⚙️ What the Code Does

Reads the dataset (Position_Salaries.csv) → Contains job position levels and corresponding salaries.

Trains a Random Forest Regressor → Models the relationship using multiple decision trees.

Makes predictions → Estimates salaries for unseen values (e.g., position level = 6.5).

Visualizes the regression curve → Uses a high-resolution grid (X_grid) to plot a smooth approximation of predicted salaries.
