Decision Tree Regression Example
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Decision Tree Regression to predict salaries based on job position levels.

Unlike Linear Regression, decision trees can effectively model non-linear relationships and capture complex patterns in the data without assuming any specific functional form.

🚀 Why It’s Important

Linear models may fail when the data follows irregular or stepwise patterns.

Decision Tree Regression splits the dataset into regions and makes constant predictions within each region.

This makes it powerful for capturing non-linear and discontinuous relationships.

Widely applied in finance, business, and scientific modeling where flexibility is key.

⚙️ What the Code Does

Reads the dataset (Position_Salaries.csv) → Contains job position levels and their corresponding salaries.

Trains a Decision Tree Regressor → Learns the relationship between position levels and salaries.

Makes predictions → Estimates salaries for unseen position levels.

Visualizes the Decision Tree Regression curve → Uses a high-resolution grid (X_grid) to show the stepwise behavior of the model.
