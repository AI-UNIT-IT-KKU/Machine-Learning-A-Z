ðŸ“„ README â€” Simple Linear Regression (Salary Prediction) Overview

This project demonstrates Simple Linear Regression using Python. The dataset (Salary_Data.csv) contains two columns: Years of Experience and Salary.

The main goal is to build a model that can learn the relationship between experience and salary, and then predict salaries for new, unseen data.

Importance

Data understanding: Shows how to load and prepare data before training.

Model training: Demonstrates how a simple regression model works.

Prediction: Teaches how to use the model to predict outcomes.

Visualization: Helps us see how well the model fits the data by plotting training and test sets.

This is a very common first step in learning Machine Learning, as it introduces data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in a simple and clear way.

Steps the code does:

Import required Python libraries.

Load the dataset (Salary_Data.csv).

Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y).

Split data into training and test sets (80/20).

Train a Linear Regression model on the training data.

Predict the salaries for the test data.

Visualize the results for both training and test sets.
