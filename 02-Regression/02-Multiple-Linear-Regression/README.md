Multiple Linear Regression Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates Multiple Linear Regression, a machine learning technique used to predict a dependent variable (Y) based on multiple independent variables (X).

Unlike Simple Linear Regression, which uses only one independent variable, Multiple Regression can handle several factors at once, making predictions more accurate and realistic.

🚀 Why It’s Important

Multiple regression is widely used in many fields, such as:

Business & Finance → Predicting profits, sales, or costs.

Healthcare → Analyzing the effect of multiple risk factors on health outcomes.

Science & Engineering → Understanding relationships between experimental variables.

It helps in analyzing relationships between factors and predicting outcomes based on real-world data.

⚙️ What the Code Does

Loads the dataset (50_Startups.csv)

Splits the data into features (X) and target (Y).

Encodes categorical variables (e.g., the State column).

Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.

Trains a Multiple Linear Regression model using the training data.

Predicts outcomes for the test data.

Compares predictions with actual values to evaluate performance.
