# Machine Learning A-Z (Python)

This repository contains my notes, code implementations, and explanations from the **Machine Learning A-Z™** course on Udemy.  
All projects are implemented in **Python** and organized by topic for better clarity and learning structure.

## 🎯 About the Course
The course covers the **foundations of Machine Learning** — from data preprocessing to advanced algorithms.  
Each topic folder includes:
- **`code.ipynb`** → Python implementation of the algorithm.  
- **`README.md`** → A clear explanation of the concept, steps, and code.
- **`Data.file`** → A Data file.
## 📘 Course Topics
1. Data Preprocessing  
2. Regression (Simple, Multiple, Polynomial, SVR, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
3. Classification (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Kernel SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
4. Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)  
5. Association Rule Learning (Apriori, Eclat)  
6. Reinforcement Learning (UCB, Thompson Sampling)  
7. Natural Language Processing  
8. Deep Learning (ANN, CNN)  
9. Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LDA)  
10. Model Selection and Boosting (Model Selection , XGBoost)

## ⚙️ Requirements
 run it on Google Colab .
