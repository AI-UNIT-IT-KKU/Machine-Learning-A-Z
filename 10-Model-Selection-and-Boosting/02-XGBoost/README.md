🚀 XGBoost Classifier Example
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the use of XGBoost Classifier to predict a target variable from a dataset.
We also evaluate the model using confusion matrix, accuracy score, and 10-Fold Cross Validation.

⚙️ Steps

Load dataset using pandas.

Split dataset into training and test sets (80% training, 20% testing).

Train XGBoost classifier on training set.

Predict results on test set.

Evaluate model performance using:

🧾 Confusion Matrix

📈 Accuracy Score

🔄 10-Fold Cross Validation for model stability

🎯 Importance

💪 XGBoost is a powerful ensemble learning method based on gradient boosting.

🔄 Cross Validation ensures that the model performs reliably on unseen data.

📊 Model evaluation provides insights into performance and generalization ability.
