Data Preprocessing Script

This Python script demonstrates the data preprocessing steps that are essential before training a machine learning model. Preprocessing ensures that the data is clean, consistent, and ready to be used by algorithms, which improves the modelâ€™s accuracy and performance.

ðŸ”‘ Key Steps in the Code

Importing Libraries

Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas are imported to handle numerical computations, visualizations, and data manipulation.

Loading the Dataset

The dataset is loaded from Data.csv using Pandas.

Features (x) and target labels (y) are separated.

Handling Missing Data

Missing values are replaced with the mean of each column using SimpleImputer.

This prevents errors in training and ensures that no data is lost.

Encoding Categorical Data (Features)

OneHotEncoder is used to convert categorical text data (like country names) into numerical format.

This is required because ML models cannot directly handle text.

Encoding the Dependent Variable (Target)

LabelEncoder is applied to convert the target variable into numeric values (e.g., Yes â†’ 1, No â†’ 0).

Splitting the Dataset

The dataset is divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

This ensures the model is trained on one portion and evaluated on another, preventing overfitting.

Feature Scaling

StandardScaler is used to normalize numerical features.

Scaling ensures that features with different ranges (e.g., age vs. salary) are treated equally by the model.

ðŸ“Œ Importance of Preprocessing

Ensures the dataset has no missing values.

Converts categorical data into machine-readable form.

Prevents bias by scaling features.

Splits data to allow fair evaluation of model performance.

This script is a fundamental step in any machine learning pipeline and prepares the data for training predictive models.
